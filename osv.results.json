This issue may have allowed limited source code exposure when the dev server was running with the App Router enabled. The vulnerability only affects local development environments and requires the user to visit a malicious webpage while `npm run dev` is active.\n\nBecause the mitigation is potentially a breaking change for some development setups, to opt-in to the fix, you must configure `allowedDevOrigins` in your next config after upgrading to a patched version. [Learn more](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/allowedDevOrigins).\n\nLearn more: https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-48068\n\n## Credit\n\nThanks to [sapphi-red](https://github.com/sapphi-red) and [Radman Siddiki](https://github.com/R4356th) for responsibly disclosing this issue.",

CPU and memory footprint are low during that time._\n\nDeployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing.\n\nThis is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel.\n\nThis vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability was resolved in Next.js 14.2.21, 15.1.2, and 13.5.8. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to the PackDraw team for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability.",
